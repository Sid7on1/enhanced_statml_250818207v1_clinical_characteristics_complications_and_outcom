Dengue outbreaks are a major public health issue, with Brazil reporting 7 1% of \nglobal cases in 2024.  \nPurpose.  This study aims to describe the profile of severe dengue patients admitted to Brazilian \nIntensive Care units ( ICUs ) (2012 \u20132024), assess trends over time, describe new onset \ncomplications while in ICU and determine the risk factors  at admission to develop \ncomplications during ICU stay . \nMethods . We performed a  prospectiv e study of dengue patients from 253 ICUs across 56 \nhospitals. We used descriptive statistics to describe the dengue ICU population , logistic \nregression  to identify risk factors for complications during the ICU stay, and a machine learning \nframework to predict the risk of evolving to complications. Visualisations were generated using \nISARIC VERTEX . \nResults . Of 11,047 admissions , 1,117 admissions (10.1%) evolved to complications, including \nnon-invasive (437 admissions) and invasive ventilation (166), vasopressor (364), blood \ntransfusion (353) and renal replacement therapy (103). Age \u226580 ( OR: 3.10, 95% CI: 2.02 -4.92), \nchronic kidney disease ( OR: 2.94, 2.22-3.89), liver cirrhosis ( OR: 3.65, 1.82 -7.04), low \nplatelets (<50,000  cells/mm\u00b3 ; OR: OR: 2.25, 1.89 -2.68), and high leukocytes (>7,000  \ncells/mm\u00b3 ; OR: 2.47, 2.02 -3.03) were significant risk factors for complications. A machine \nlearning tool for predicting complications  was proposed , show ing accurate discrimination and \ncalibration . \nConclusion . We described a large cohort of dengue patients admitted to ICU s and identified \nkey risk factors for severe dengue complications , such as advanced age, presence of \ncomorbidities, high er level  of leukocytes and lower level of platelets . The proposed prediction \ntool can be used for early identification and targeted interventions to improve outcomes in \ndengue -endemic regions.  \nKeywords:  Dengue; Intensive Care; Risk Factors; Clinical Management; Prediction  \n\n--- Page 3 ---\n3 \n Introduction  \nDengue is a mosquito -borne viral infection caused by the dengue virus (DENV) transmitted \nprimarily by Aedes aegypti , having  four different serotypes and multiple genotypes [1]. Dengue \noutbreak s are frequent public health  events  affecting populations and health systems from \nnumerous countries, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions [2]. Currently, the disease \nis endemic in more than 100 countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported over \n14.3 million cases and 10,839  deaths  in 2024 , a sharp increase compared to the 4.6 million \ncases and 2,400 deaths recorded in 2023 [3]. Brazil appears  as the most affected country, \naccounting for 7 1% of global reported cases and 57% of deaths, with 10.2 million cases and \n6,239  deaths in 2024, marking the highest dengue outbreak globally [3]. \nRegarding severe dengue cases, the WHO reported 52,311  severe cases worldwide in \n2024, with Brazil accounting for 8,268 of these cases [3]. Despite the expanding outbreak, \ncomprehensive studies on the clinical characteristics of severe dengue patients remain scarce. \nExisting literature has primarily focused on sociodemographic factors and general symptoms \nrather than detailed clinical profiles [4]. Few studies analy sed clinical risk factors of severe \ndengue; however, they used small  cohort size s (<200 patients)  to develop the analysis [5,6] . To \naddress this gap, this study aims to analy se the characteristics of severe dengue patients \nadmitted to Intensive Care Units (ICUs) over a 13 -year period (2012 \u20132024) within one of \nBrazil\u2019s largest hospital networks. Additionally, it seeks to identify clinical risk factors \nassociated with complicatio ns during ICU stays. Severe dengue can lead to critical conditions \nsuch as severe plasma leakage, haemorrhage , or organ failure, which may escalate rapidly \nduring the critical phase of illness, requiring urgent intervention to  prevent mortality [1]. \nThe key research questions addressed in this study are: (i) What are the demographic \nand clinical profiles of ICU dengue patients; (ii) How has this profile changed from 2012 to \n\n--- Page 4 ---\n4 \n 2024; (iii) How many patients develop complications during ICU stays; and (iv) What are the \nrisk factors  at ICU admission  for developing  complications  during ICU stay . \n \nMaterials and M ethods  \nStudy Design  \nThis is a prospectively study considering all ICU admissions from January 2012 to June 2024. \nThe study was conducted across 253 general medical -surgical ICUs within 56 hospitals  from \n14 Brazilian states , all part of an integrated hospital network (Rede D\u2019Or -Sao Luiz) , and \naccording to the STROBE statement [7]. The study received approval from both the local Ethics \nCommittee and the Brazilian National Ethics Committee (CAAE: 17079119.7.0000.5249)  and \nthe need for informed consent was waived due to its retrospective observational design . \n \nParticipants and data collection  \nWe extracted all anonymized data from an electronic system designed for ICU quality \nimprovement and benchmarking (Epimed  Monitor\u00ae, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) [8]. This database \nincludes prospectively collected structured data on all adult ICU admissions  (\u226516 years old) , \nproviding comprehensive clinical information. It captures features collected at admission (first \n24h), such as patient demographics, ICU admission diagnoses, comorbidities, illness severity \nscores, and use of organ support ; and the highest or lowest haematological values collected at \nfirst 1h of ICU admission . We also have complications and outcomes collected during the \ncomplete ICU stay, such as use of devices, ICU and hospital mortality, as well as length of stay  \n(LOS) . Table S1 shows the data dictionary including a complete description of each variable \ncomprised  in the study. The inclusion criteria were  patients with confirmed dengue infection \nat ICU admission (primary or secondary diagnosis based on laborator y confirmation) . In this \nprospectively collected database, patients are prospectively categorized by a standardized form \n\n--- Page 5 ---\n5 \n in \"main reason of ICU admission\", which reflects the primary admission diagnosis, and for \nother secondary reasons of ICU admission. We excluded admissions with undefined  outcome  \n(42 admissions) , readmissions within 30 days  (32 admissions) , and patients with undefined sex \n(three admissions)  (Figure S1) . Since patient sex will be one of the model\u2019s confounders, t he \nexclusion of  undefined sex is related to the few cases in this category.   \n \nOutcomes  \nThe primary outcome of interest was the presence of any complication during the ICU stay, \ndefined as  a clinically significant event requiring ICU -level intervention and prompting a clear \nchange in management or resource utilization, such as : 1) the need for organ support (e.g., \ninvasive mechanical ventilation , non-invasive ventilation  vasopressor drugs , or renal \nreplacement therapy ); 2) any blood product transfusion  (e.g., red blood cells, platelets and fresh \nfrozen plasma) ; or (3) death . The secondary outcomes were 60 -day ICU and in-hospital \nmortality,  and ICU and in-hospital LOS . \n \nStatistical  analysis  \nWe used descriptive statistics to describe the ICU population, including demographics, illness \nseverity, comorbidities, complications, laboratory tests, and outcomes. Categorical variables \nwere expressed as frequencies and proportions , while continuous variables were summarized \nas medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). We included p -values to a ssess differences between \ngroups (complicated vs not complicated). The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for continuous \nvariables and the Pearson\u2019s Chi -squared test was employed  for categorical ones . To illustrate \ntrends over time, we included bar and line plots showing the time series of ICU admissions and \noutcomes  across the years.  \n\n--- Page 6 ---\n6 \n To identify risk factors for complications during the ICU stay, we evaluated the association \nbetween patient clinical characteristics and the primary outcome . The set of features included \nin the analysis was selected by clinical relevance . Collinearity among variables was pre -\nassessed using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient . Then , we used a univariable logistic \nregression  model to estimate the individual association between each variable  and the outcome . \nWe selected the features  to the multivariable logistic regression based on clinical judgment and \nconsidering the p-value  of the univariable  regression. Association was calculated by the \nestimated odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).   \nWe also developed a model to predict the risk of evolving dengue ICU complications  \nfollowing a machine learning framework [9,10] . We used stratified random sampling [11] to \nsplit 80% of the dataset for training and 20% for testing . Stratified random sampling select s a \nsample from a population by dividing the population into subgroups (strata) based on shared \ncharacteristics and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum. This ensures that each \nsubgroup is adequately represented in the training and testing samp le [12]. We trained and \ncompared the Logistic Regression with two machine learning models  (Gradient Boosting \nMachine and Randon Forests ) using the set of risk factors obtained from the previous analysis. \nWe used 10 -fold cross \u2013validation to tune the models  and evaluated them  based on  \ndiscrimination and calibration measures. Discrimination was measured by the Area Under the \nCurve (AUC) and calibration was addressed by the calibration belts [13]. Variables with more \nthan 30% missing data were excluded from the multivariable analysis, while the remaining \nvariables were imputed using the Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) \nalgorithm [14].  \nWe performed two experiments  in terms of prediction modelling : (i) the first one used the \nsame set of features from the previous multivariable analysis; (ii) the second one grouped all \ncomorbidities into one unique feature, called \u201cnumber of comorbidities\u201d, which has three \n\n--- Page 7 ---\n7 \n categories  (0; 1-2; 3+). We developed an open -source website including the risk calculator that \ncould be  used to generate the predictions  of complications for ICU dengue patients : \nhttps://l4x2nl -igor-peres.shinyapps.io/Dengue_Risk_Calculator/ . We also included the model \nformulation in the results in case other researchers want to apply our model in different \ncontexts.  \nPlots and figures were generated using ISARIC VERTEX [15], a web -based application \nthat produces tables and visualizations to support key research questions. VERTEX is part of \nthe ISARIC Clinical Epidemiology Platform, developed to standardize and streamline data \ncollection and analysis in outbreak -related clini cal research. A public implementation of \nVERTEX for this study is available at: https://projects.vertex.isaric.org/?param=Dengue_ICU . \nThe developed codes for VERTEX are publicly available at GitHub  \n(https://github.com/ISARICResearch/VERTEX ). \n \nResults  \nA total of 11,047 adult patients were included  in the  analysis . The median age was 45 years \n(IQR: 32 -63) and 91% were from the emergency department  (Table 1) . The median SAPS -3 \nwas 40 (36 -46) and with a median SOFA of 2 (0-3).  The 60-day in -hospital mortality was \n1.4% (n=157)  and the median hospital  LOS  was 5 (3 -7). A total of 1,117 admissions (10.1%) \ndeveloped complications  during ICU stay , such as non -invasive ventilation ( n=437; 4.0%), use \nof vasopressor ( n=364; 3.3%), blood transfusion ( n=353; 3.2%), invasive mechanical \nventilation ( n=166; 1.5%), renal replacement therapy ( n=103; 0.9%) and high -flow nasal \ncannula ( n=23; 0.2%). Hypertension ( n=3,291; 30%), diabetes ( n=1,644; 15%) and \ncardiovascular disease ( n=913; 8.3%) were the most prevalent comorbidities.  Among the 1,117 \npatients who developed compl ications  during ICU stay , 364 (33%) required vasopressors or \nhad shock at admission  (first 24h) , while 311 (28%) required non-invasive  ventilation. \n\n--- Page 8 ---\n8 \n Mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy were less common at admission, \nobserved in 86 (7.7%) and 60 (5.4%) patients, respectively.  \nTable 1.

Similarly, the \nproportion of patients with complications decreased, dropping from 16% in 2012 \u20132021 to 10% \n\n--- Page 10 ---\n10 \n in 2022 \u20132023 and further to 8. 7% in 2024  (p < 0.001) . The complete profile of ICU patients \nover the years can be assessed in Table S2. \nFigure 1. a) Admissions and in -hospital mortality  rate of ICU dengue patients over time ; b) \n60-day in -hospital mortality  rate; and c) proportion of admission with any complication . \n \n \n \nComplications during ICU Stay  \nDuring the complete ICU stay, vasopressors or shock management were necessary for \n430 patients (38%), while non -invasive ventilation was used in 437 patients (39%). Other \ncomplications included transfusions (353; 32%), mechanical ventilation (166; 15%), renal \nreplacement therapy (103; 9 .2%), and high -flow nasal cannula (23; 2.1%).  Patients with \ncomplications had longer ICU and hospital LOS (p < 0.001), with a median of 4 (3 -7) and 7 \n(5-11) days, respectively, compared to 3 (2 -4) and 5 (3 -6) days in patient s without \ncomplications. Mortality was significantly higher in the former group (p < 0.001), with a 60 -\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n11 \n day ICU mortality rate of 8.7% and a 60 -day hospital mortality rate of 11%, compared to 0.1% \nand 0.4% in patients without complications. The patients who died were older (75, 59 -85), with \na higher proportion coming from the ward, floor or step -down unit (1 6%), presenting a greater \nnumber of comorbidities, and had higher severity scores (SAPS -3 = 57, 51 -67; SOFA = 4, 2 -\n7; 36% of frail patients). More than half of the patients who required mechanical ventilation \n(58%) or vasopressor (54%) died, with these two  complications being the most impactful on \nmortality outcomes. The mortality was lower in patients with non -invasive ventilation (27%), \ntransfusion (25%), renal replacement therapy (21%), and high -flow nasal cannula (3.8%).  \nPatients who developed complications in the ICU showed distinct laboratory values \nduring the first hours of admission compared to those without complications  (Table 1) . Patients \nwith any complications presented similar median lowest platelet counts at admission compared \nto those without (median 88,000, IQR: 52,000 -139,000; vs. 89,000 IQR: 37,000 -151,000 \ncells/mm\u00b3; p = 0.2 ). However, patients with complications had higher leukocyte count (5,100, \n3,200 -9,000; vs. 3,700, 2,600 -5,800 cells/mm\u00b3; p < 0.001)  and a rterial lactate levels (1.64, 1.2 -\n2.6; vs. 1.4, 1.1 -2.0 mmol/L; p < 0.001 ) at admission compared to those without complications. \nBlood pressure and creatinine showed smaller differences but consistently suggested a more \nsevere profile among patients with complications. The lowest systolic, diastolic and mean \narterial pressures did not show significant variations. The median age was higher in the \ncomplication group [58 (38 -74) vs 44 (32 -61); p < 0.001 ] and the proportion of female sex was \nsimilar [51% vs. 52 %; p = 0.5]. All comorbidities were more frequent in the complication \ngroup, except asthma (p = 0.4).  \nIn Figure 2, we observe that as age and the number of comorbidities increase, so does \nthe likelihood of developing at least one complication in the ICU  (Figure 2b) . The proportion \nof patients developing complications is greater for young adults (16 -19 years old) with three \nor more comorbidities, and we also can note that for all ages the higher the number of \n\n--- Page 12 ---\n12 \n comorbidities the greater the proportion of complications  (Figure 2b) . Patient sex did not \nappear to be related to the  absolute  risk of complication  (Figure 2a) . Additionally, admissions \nfrom 2012 to 2023 reported a greater  proportion of complications than those from 2024  (Figure \n2c). Figure s 2d-2f also illustrates the relationship between ICU complications and platelet, \nleukocyte, and lactate levels  (at first 1h of admission) , stratified by age groups. Across all ages, \nlactate levels above 3 mmol/L and leukocyte counts above 7,000  cells/mm\u00b3 (leucocytosis) were \nassociated with an increased risk of progression to complications  (Figures 2e and 2f) . \nRegarding platelets, although the univariate analysis of Table 1 did not reveal significant effect \nof platelets count  using the continuous value , when we stratify in categories,  we can note that \nlevels below 50,000 cells/mm\u00b3  (thrombocytopenia)  appeared to increase risk across most age \ngroups  (Figure 2d) . The same effect could be noted when analysing the density distribution of \nthese three laboratory variables (Figure S2).  Therefore, we could  note that patients with \nthrombo cytopenia, leucocytosis and elevated lactate at baseline ( first 1h of ICU admission ) \nwere at risk of additional or new complications during  ICU stay. \nFigure 2. Complications by age, sex, number of comorbidities, period of time , platelet  levels , \nleukocyte  levels and lactate levels , stratified by age groups . \n \n \n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n13 \n We also analysed the characteristics of these admissions which appears to be in the \nhigher risk group. Compared to the overall population, t he patients who presented platelets \nlower than 50,000  cells/mm\u00b3 had greater proportion of new complicat ions (13.6%) and similar \nage composition (45, 33 -61) and slightly higher severity scores (SAPS -3 = 45, 42 -50; SOFA = \n3, 3-4; 5.6% of frail patients). The most prevalent complication was the blood transfusion \n(8.8%), followed by vasopressor use or shock (3.2%),  non-invasive ventilation (2.6%), \nmechanical ventilation (1.4%), renal replacement therapy (0.9%), and high -flow nasal cannula \n(<0.1%). The ICU morta lity rate (1.1%) and ICU LOS  (3, 2 -4) for th is subgroup of  \nthrombocytopenia patients  were similar to the general population  [1.0% and 3(2, 4), \nrespectively] . \nRegarding the patients who presented leukocyte counts above 7,000  cells/mm\u00b3 , they  \npresented  greater risk of becoming complicated (1 8.4%) and presented similar age composition \n(45, 3 2-65) and severity scores (SAPS -3 = 4 2, 37-49; SOFA = 2, 0-3; 11% of frail patients). \nThe most prevalent complication was non-invasive ventilation ( 8.0%) followed by vasopressor \nuse or shock ( 7.9%), blood transfusion ( 5.2%), mechanical ventilation ( 4.6%), renal \nreplacement therapy ( 2.7%), and high -flow nasal cannula (0. 5%). The ICU mortality rate \n(2.9%) for this subgroup of leucocytosis patients were higher compared to the general \npopulation (1.0% ); however, the ICU LOS presented similar statistics (3, 2 -5). \n \nRisk factors of ICU complications during ICU Stay  \nTable 2 shows the univariable  and multivariable logistic regression to investigate the \nrelationship between demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables and the risk of developing  \ncomplications  in the ICU . The features included in the model did not present  notable \ncollinearity (Figure S3 ). We observed in the univariable  model that older age [80+, odds ratio \n(OR): 5.59, 95% CI: 3.77 -8.61; p<0.001 ]; the presence of chronic kidney disease (OR: 5.12, \n\n--- Page 14 ---\n14 \n 3.96-6.58; p<0.001 ), liver cirrhosis (OR: 4.49, 2.35 -8.24; p<0.001 ), cerebrovascular disease \n(OR: 3.20, 2.51 -4.06; p<0.001 ), obesity (OR: 2.32, 1.67 -3.15; p<0.001 ) and \nimmunosuppression (OR: 2.76, 2.03 -3.69; p<0.001 ) were independently associated with \ncomplications . Additionally, l ow platelet counts (<50 ,000 cells/mm\u00b3 ) (OR: 2.12, 1.79-2.51; \np<0.001 ), and high leukocyte counts (>7 ,000 cells/mm\u00b3 , OR: 3.43, 2.82-4.18; p<0.001 ) were \nindependently associated with the primary outcome .  \nTable 2.

With a sample size of over 11,000 patients, this represents one of the \nlargest datasets on dengue in critically ill populations.  \nWe identified several significant risk factors for complications in ICU dengue patients, \nincluding advanced age, associated comorbidities ( chronic kidney disease, liver cirrhosis, \nobesity, cerebrovascular disease, malignancy, tobacco consumption, cardiovascular disease, \ndiabetes , and immunosuppression ) and laboratory markers (low platelet levels and elevated \nleukocyte levels) . These findings are consistent with those of Copaja -Corzo et al. [5] and Carras \net al. [6]. Copaja -Corzo et al. [5] identified cardiovascular disease, elevated liver enzymes, and \nhypofibrinogenemia as key predictors of severe dengue. Comorbidities such as liver cirrhosis \nare commonly associated with elevated liver enzymes levels . Additionally,  comorbidities such \nas liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease and immunosuppression  are usually related to \nhypofibrinogenemia . Carras et al. [6] highlighted the history of cardiovascular disease, the \ndelayed hospital presentation (time from first symptom to hospital consultation over two days) \nand being of Western European  origin as significant  predictors for severe dengue . \nOur findings on the predictive value of low platelet counts and high leukocyte levels \nalign with those of T rach et al. [16] and Moallemi et al. [17], literature reviews who emphasized \nthe importance of haematological  markers, including platelet counts and liver enzymes, in \ndengue prognosis. However, our study goes further by integrating these biomarkers into a \nmachine learning model to predict complications, achieving an AUC of 0.7 1. This approach \nprovides a more dynamic and actionable tool for clinicians, particularly in resource -limited \nsettings where early identification of high -risk patients is crucial.  \n\n--- Page 18 ---\n18 \n The reviews of Chagas et al. [18] and D\u00edaz -Quijano et al. [19] also identified advanced \nage, comorbidities (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and organ dysfunction \n(particularly liver and kidney dysfunction) as significant predictors of mortality and bleeding \ncomplications, respectively. These findings ar e consistent with our results, where low platelet \nlevels and elevated liver enzymes were associated with complications. While D\u00edaz -Quijano et \nal.[19] specifically focused on bleeding complications, our study aligns with their findings on \nthe importance of platelet counts in predicting severe outcomes.  Paran\u00e1 et al. [4] systematic \nreviewed and meta -analysed risk factors associated with severe dengue in Latin America and \nindicated that secondary dengue infection, female sex, white race and specific signs and \nsymptoms were significant predictors of severe dengue outcomes . However, the review  \nidentified a lack of studies focusing on clinical characteristics related to severe dengue.  \nInterestingly, our findings on risk factors for severe dengue complications share \nsimilarities with those of Kallas et al. [20] in their study on predictors of mortality in patients \nwith yellow fever. Both studies identified advanced age, liver dysfunction, and renal failure as \nsignificant predictors of poor outcomes. However, Kallas et al. [20] also emphasized the role of \ncoagulopathy and elevated bilirubin levels, which were not as prominently featured in our \nstudy. This difference may reflect the distinct pathophysiological mechanisms of dengue and \nyellow fever, with yellow fever being more li kely to cause severe hepatic injury and \ncoagulopathy.  \nOur analysis of trends over time revealed a significant increase in dengue admissions \nin 2024, coinciding with a global surge in cases reported by the WHO [3]. Despite this increase, \nwe observed a decline in  complication and  mortality rates, which may reflect improvements in \nICU management and early intervention strategies. This finding contrasts with Copaja -Corzo \net al. [5], who reported higher mortality rates in their cohort (8.6%), possibly due to differences \nin healthcare infrastructure, resource availability, and the severity of dengue strains between \n\n--- Page 19 ---\n19 \n Brazil and Peru. Other studies have also analysed  temporal trends in dengue mortality. Shepard \net al. [21] conducted a comprehensive analysis of dengue mortality trends across multiple \ncountries, highlighting significant regional variations in mortality rates. They found that while \nsome regions experienced declining mortality due to improved healthcare access and public \nhealth interventions, others saw stable or increasing mortality rates, particularly in areas with \nlimited resources. Similarly, Limkittikul et al. [22] analysed  dengue mortality trends in \nThailand over a 20 -year period, reporting a gradual decline in mortality rates due to better \ndisease management and public health measures. However, they noted periodic spikes in \nmortality during severe outbreaks.  \nOur machine learning model, which predicts complications including few features and \nwith an AUC of 0.7 1, represents a significant advancement in dengue risk stratification. Several \nother studies have also explored the use of machine learning in dengue prognosis. Most of them \nanalysed the prediction of severe dengue for hospitalised patients or the risk of ICU admission. \nTorres et al. [23] demonstrated the utility of machine learning in identifying early markers of \ndengue severity  for hospitalised paediatric patients developing a model to predict the risk of \nICU admission , while Huang et al. [24] highlighted the importance of combining demographic \nand laboratory data for accurate risk prediction  of severe dengue in hospitalized patients  (using \nWHO 2009 classification) . Madewell et al. [25] had the same objective and used clinical and \nenvironmental data to predict severe dengue  for hospitalised patients , while Sarma et al. [26] \nexplored various machine learning algorithms for dengue prediction  for hospitalised patients , \nshowcasing the versatility of these approaches. Our study  aligns with the broader trend of using \nadvanced machine learning techniques to improve dengue risk stratification ; however, our \nfocus regards to ICU patients . The severe dengue literature lacks in studies analysing critical \nill patients. The identification of key risk factors, such as advanced age, chronic comorbidities \nand abnormal laboratory markers  and t he use of our  proposed  model  integrated into clinical \n\n--- Page 20 ---\n20 \n decision -support systems , which predicts complications with reasonable accuracy, can be used \nfor early identification of high -risk patients  in Intensive Care Units . This is particularly relevant \nin dengue -endemic regions, where timely intervention can significantly reduce mortality and \nICU resource utilization.  \nOne of the strengths of our study is the large, nationally representative dataset, which \nprovides granular insights into the critical care context of dengue management. Our machine \nlearning model shows promise, although further validation in external cohorts is needed to \nensure its generalizability.  We have the following limitations: (i) we analysed a cohort of \nprivate ICU patients , which may have different presentation and risk factors than more general \npopulations of dengue patients. However, we showed data from a large network of hospitals \nwith adequate resource availability; and (ii) our definition focuses on objective, clinically \nsignificant events \u2014namely, the need for organ support, blood transfusions, and death \u2014which \ncapture complications relevant to ICU -level care. These outcomes partially overlap with the \nWHO definition of severe d engue [1], which is  widely used for triage and early severity \nstratification in dengue. However, its direct application in the ICU setting is limited, as it was \nnot specifically designed to reflect the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients.  \nWe believe that clinical interventions (e.g., transfusion) provide a more actionable and \nmeaningful marker of disease severity than laboratory thresholds alone.  We acknowledge that \nthis approach may reduce external generalizability. At the same time, we believe it provides a \nuseful framework for characterizing clinical severity in ICU patients and could serve as a \nfoundation for future studies aiming to validate ICU -specific severity definitions in dengue .   \nFuture research should focus on validating our predictive model in diverse settings and \nexploring the impact of targeted interventions on patient outcomes , such as the ICU datasets of \nISARIC hubs in Colombia and Pakistan . Additionally, studies should investigate the role of \nemerging biomarkers and genetic factors in dengue prognosis, which could further refine risk \n\n--- Page 21 ---\n21 \n stratification and treatment strategies.  Moreover, future studies should also evaluate the impact \nof new dengue vaccine s approved to be used (e.g., QDenga  in Brazil ) in the incidence, death \nand in -hospital mortality.  \n \nConclusion  \nWe described a large cohort of dengue patients admitted to ICUs and identified key risk \nfactors for severe dengue complications, such as advanced age, presence of comorbidities, \nelevated  level of leukocytes and low platelets  levels . The proposed prediction tool can be used \nfor early identification and targeted interventions to improve outcomes in dengue -endemic \nregions. By integrating clinical and laboratory data into predictive models, we provide a \nfoundation for more effective and personalized care strategies, which are urgently needed in \nthe face of increasing dengue burden worldwide.  As dengue continues to pose a major public \nhealth challenge, particularly in endemic regions, the insig hts from this study can inform both \nclinical practice and public health strategies to mitigate its impact.  \n \nFunding  \nThis work was supported by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and \nTechnological Development (CNPq) [ 403379/2024 -5, 444968/2023 -7 and 312654/2023 -5 to \nS.H; 420096/2023 -0 to L.B ; 309546/2025 -7 to I.P ]; the Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for \nResearch Support in Rio de Janeiro State (FAPERJ) [E -26/210.858/2024 and E -\n26/204.540/2024 to I.P; E -26/204.520/2024 to L.B ; E-26/204.187/2024 to S.H ]; the Ram\u00f3n y \nCajal program [RYC2023 -002923 -C to O.R]  awarded by the Spanish Ministry of Science ; the \nInnovation and Universities [MICIU/AEI/10.13039/501100011033  to O.R];  the Wellcome \nTrust [303666/Z/23/Z]; UK International Development [301542 -403]; the Gates Foundation \n[INV -063472]; the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) ; the Coordination for the Improvement \n\n--- Page 22 ---\n22 \n of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES); and the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de \nJaneiro.  \n \nAuthor Contributions  \n Conceptualization, F.B, I.P , L.B and O.R ; Data curation  and formal analysis, I.P; \nInvestigation,  F.B, I.P, L.B , O.R, and S.H; Methodology,  I.P and O.R ; Project administration, \nF.B and S.H; Resources, F.B, I.P and S.H ; Software, I.P, E.G  and T.E; Supervision, F.B, I.P, \nL.B, O.R, and S.H ; Validation, F.B, I.P, L.B, O.R, and S.H ; Visualization , I.P, E.G  and T.E; \nRoles/Writing - original draft, I.P and O.R; and Writing - review & editing, F.B, I.P, L.B, O.R,  \nE.G, T.E  and S.H . \n \nReferences  \n[1] Organization WH.
